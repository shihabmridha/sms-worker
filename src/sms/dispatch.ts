/**
 * Ported from acadion's SmsService.ts (the provider-failover composite),
 * turned from a class into a function over a priority-ordered provider list.
 *
 * Try providers in order until every recipient is accepted, retrying only the
 * recipients still outstanding. Both a soft decline (`accepted: false`) and a
 * thrown transport error fall through to the next provider — at-least-once
 * delivery (see CONTEXT.md "Dispatch"). A thrown error is ambiguous (the SMS
 * may already have been sent), so failover can produce a duplicate; that
 * trade-off is accepted so a flaky primary never silently drops a message.
 * Providers that batch internally confine a throw to the chunk that actually
 * failed, which keeps the duplicate blast radius to that chunk rather than
 * the whole send.
 *
 * Never throws for provider failures: returns an aggregated soft failure per
 * unresolved recipient so callers decide how loud to be. The result is
 * always the same length and order as the input recipients.
